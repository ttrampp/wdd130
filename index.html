                <p>Hello, my name is Tanya Trampp. I live in New Mexico, USA. My husband is my absolute best friend, who I love growing old with. I am a mother and grandmother to many. Most people call me Mama Trampp. Movies, games, campfires, family and much more is what brings me giggles. Is it naptime yet? I spend most of my daytime hours being the co-pilot in the hearts and minds of my two youngest children. Homeschooling, gardening, farm animals, group activities, church activities, college classes, bookkeeping for a local business, laundry, meals, life... all make me question how did I ever have the time when I worked outside the home. Oh wait, I didn't. I love my life. I am not eager to share it here. However, this is the assignment. It must be time for that nap now!</p>
